We are happy to present the first LEAPSyn-SCI publication: Efficient protein extraction for shotgun
proteomics from hydrated and desiccated leaves of resurrection Ramonda serbica plants, by Marija
Vidović, Cinzia Franchin, Filis Morina, Sonja Veljović-Jovanović, Antonio Masi, Giorgio Arrigoni in
Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry (2020). The presented study paves the way for investigating the
involvement of LEA proteins in <em>R. serbica</em> desiccation tolerance.
