On 21th of September, 2020 our project made appearance on the Serbian Broadcaster RTS1. The goal was to introduce future benifits of "LEAPSyn-SCI – Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins: Structural Characterisation and Interaction with α-Synuclein” project within the PROMIS program. The overall objective of the Project: reduction of the aggregation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) by desiccation-related Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins in order to promote the development of the novel strategies to treat Parkinson’s disease.
