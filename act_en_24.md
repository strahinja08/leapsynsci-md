LEAPSyn-SCI team has just published a review entitled “ Alpha-synuclein aggregation pathway in Parkinson's disease: current status and novel therapeutic approaches" in Cells. The review emphasizes the importance of inhibiting alpha-synuclein aggregation to treat Parkinson's disease and elaborates on the latest research in this direction. Aiming to develop new and effective therapeutic approaches against Parkinsonćs disease, the authors emphasize the development and application of rationally designed peptides and peptidomimetics that can complementarily bind to toxic alpha-synuclein species and thus inhibit its further aggregation.
