Brain Awareness Weak is held in March, with the goal of popularizing neuroscience. This year, the LEAPSyn- SCI project aims to promote the importance of developing new treatments in the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's. The idea of LEAPSyn- SCI is to inhibit Î±-Syn with LEA proteins of the Serbian Ramonda plant, which in turn fights Parkinson's disease.
