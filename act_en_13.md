The project tackles the problem of LEA proteins production from an endemic resurrection plant, <i>Ramonda serbica</i>, and examines their potential to prevent α-synuclein aggregation in order to encourage the development of new therapies in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and similar neurodegenerative diseases based on abnormal peptide / protein aggregation. The project presentation will be held online in the session, starting at <b>11h</b>.
